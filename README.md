# Machine-Learning

This repository contains my day-to-day work in Machine Learning. It includes notes, practice code, mini-projects, and tasks that I complete while learning new concepts.
The goal of this repo is to stay organized, track progress over the semester, and build a solid foundation in ML through consistent hands-on practice.
